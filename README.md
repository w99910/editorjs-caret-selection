# EditorJs Caret Selection

Effortlessly track and simulate caret movements across any device. In real-time collaboration tools like Notion or Google Docs, you've likely noticed a caret indicating when another user is editing or viewing the same document.

I developed this feature because, as of this writing, the official EditorJs has not yet implemented it. Feel free to use, customize, and configure it to suit your needs. Cheers! ðŸ¥‚ðŸ¥‚
